		<p class="pabout"> Hi, My name is Nikki. I am currently a high school freshman interested in computer science and journalism. I love writing for the school newspaper and learning more about JavaScript in the girls who code club. 
		</p>
    <p class="pabout">
      One of my favorite hobbies is figure skating which I do with my friends. It's an awesome workout and fun time! The current jump I'm working on is 1 and 1/2 rotations in the air. 
      </p>
    <p class="pabout"> 
      When I'm not studying for school, I might be running with friends, rereading the Harry Potter series, or hiking. My favorite places to hike are in Salt Lake City, Utah. I definitely recommend taking a trip there:).
